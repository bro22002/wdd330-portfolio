                    <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
                    Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. These are the type of errors in
                        programming: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>System error: an error due to a problem with the system or failure of the program to
                                interact with external devices</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Programmer error: error caused by incorrect syntax by the programmer</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>User error: error caused by the incorrect input or data by the user which the program
                                can’t handle</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    As programmers, we must ensure that errors are minimized and fixed promptly. We should try to limit
                    user errors by predicting any possible errors and providing a solution to handle them to give a
                    better user experience. This can be done by raising or using exceptions.

                    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
                    <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value used by the program to deal with errors.
                        Exceptions also produce a <strong>stack trace</strong>. The stack trace is a sequence of
                        functions or methods that leads to calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It
                        works backward through the sequence from the point of error to identify the original function or
                        method that caused the error.</p>

                    <h3>Warnings</h3>
                    <p>Warnings occur when an error in a code isn’t enough to cause the program to crash. This means
                        that the program will continue to run after the warning is raised. This can be problematic
                        because the warning may cause the program to run incorrectly. Below is an example of a warning
                        caused by an undeclared variable: <br>
                        <code>
                        pi = 3.142; <br>
                        &lt;&lt; JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable
                    </code>
                    </p>
                </article>
            </li>
            <li>
                <article>
                    <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
                    <p>Writing code in strict mode can also help improve its clarity and speed since it follows
                        conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used. Not using strict
                        mode is often referred to as “sloppy mode” as it’s forgiving of sloppy programming practices.
                        Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written. It is recommended to use
                        the strict mode. To use the strict mode, just add the following string to the first line of a
                        JavaScript file: <br>
                        <code>'use strict';</code><br>
                        You can also use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the line inside a function.
                        Strict mode will then only be applied to anything inside that function: <br>
                        <code>
                        function strictly(){<br>
                            'use strict';<br>
                            // function code goes here <br>
                            }                            
                    </code><br>
                        <em><strong>NB</strong>: ES6 introduced JavaScript modules (covered later in chapter 15). These
                            are self-contained pieces of code that are in strict mode by default, so the
                            <code>'use strict'</code> declaration is not required.</em>

                    <h3>Linting tools</h3>
                    <p>These are tools that are designed to highlight sloppy programming practices and syntax errors.
                        They can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code beyond the strict mode. Linting tools
                        are useful to enforce programming styles guide. Examples of linting tools are JS Lint, JS Hint,
                        and ES Lint.</p>

                    <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
                    <p>Is a way of checking for browser support for a feature. We can use JavaScript to check for
                        feature detection using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before
                        trying to call the method. This ensures that no error occurs if the browser doesn’t support the
                        method. Calling the method outside the if block would cause an exception to be thrown. Feature
                        detection guarantees that the method is only called if it actually exists and fails gracefully,
                        without any exceptions being thrown, if the method doesn’t exist. <code>Window.holoDeck</code>
                        doesn’t exist.</p><br>
                    <code>
                        if (window.holoDeck) {<br>
                            virtualReality.activate();<br>
                            }                            
                    </code>

                    <h3>Debugging in the Browser</h3>
                    <p>Debugging is the process of finding bugs in your code and fixing them. Mostly, the point at which
                        the error occurs is not where it originated. When debugging, we can set breakpoints that halt
                        the progress of the code through steps and help us to check the value of different variables at
                        that point of the program. We can use alert (), console.log (), and console.trace () methods to
                        debug in JavaScript. The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to
                        interactively find and fix bugs in code. <br></p>
                    <p>One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your
                        code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is
                        currently up to. You can also hover over any variables to see what value they hold at that
                        point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on the play button. <br>
                        The example below uses the debugger command to debug a function: <br>
                        <code>
                            function amIOldEnough(age){<br>
                                debugger;<br>
                                if (age &lt; 12) {<br>
                                debugger;<br>
                                return 'No, sorry.';<br>
                                } else if (age &lt; 18) {<br>
                                debugger;<br>
                                return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';<br>
                                } else {<br>
                                debugger;<br>
                                return 'Yep, come on in!';<br>
                                }<br>
                                }                                
                        </code><br>
                        <em><strong>NB</strong>: Remember to remove any references to the debugger command before
                            shipping any code, otherwise the program will appear to freeze when people try to use
                            it!</em>

                    <h3>Error Objects</h3>
                    <p>An error object is created when an exception occurs. It can also be created in the code using a
                        constructor function that takes an error message as a parameter. <br>
                        <code>const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');</code>

                    <h3>Throwing Exceptions</h3>
                    <p>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement. This will allow for any problems in your code
                        to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background. The throw
                        statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to
                        stop. It is best practice, however, to throw an error object. Example: throw new
                        Error('Something has gone badly wrong!');</p>

                    <h3>Exception Handling (try, catch, finally)</h3>
                    <p>If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. This
                        will run the code inside the block as normal. Any code placed inside a try block will pass any
                        error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will
                        run if an exception does or does not occur. <br>
                        <code>
                        function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {<br>
                            'use strict';<br>
                            let answer;<br>
                            try {<br>
                            answer = String(squareRoot(number));<br>
                            } catch(error) {<br>
                            answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";<br>
                            } finally {<br>
                            return `+ or - ${answer}`;<br>
                            }<br>
                            }                            
                    </code>

                    <h3>Tests</h3>
                    <p>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that
                        passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.</p>
