            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>
              in programming are used to refer to values stored in the computer
              memory. In the JavaScript ES6 version, there are two ways to
              declare variables. Variables must be declared before they can be
              used in our code. To declare a variable, you can use
              <code>const</code> and the <code>let</code> keywords. The
              difference between the <code>const</code> and the
              <code>let</code> is, the <code>const</code> keyword is used when
              the value of the variable is not reassigned or changed while the
              <code>let</code> keyword is used when the value of the variable is
              reassigned later in the program. Below are examples of declaring
              variables using <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.<br />
              <code>const name = “Brown”</code><br />
              <code>let number = 0</code>

            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>
              is a concept in programming that refers to where a constant or
              variable is accessible in the program. Scopes can be either global
              or local.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Variables declared outside a block are said to have a global
                scope. That is, it can be used everywhere in the program.
              </li>
              <li>
                Variables declared inside a block using the let and const are
                said to have a local scope. That is, their values are limited
                inside their blocks and cannot be accessed from the outside.

            <h3>Template Literals</h3>
            <p>
              this is a special type of string that uses the backtick character
              to enclose a string. The advantage of using a template literal is
              its ability to use both types of quotation marks. Here is an
              example of using a template literal. <code>`Hello World`</code>

            <h3>Arrays</h3>
            <p>
              are built-in objects that store an ordered list of values. In
              JavaScript, an array can be created using the following snippet
              <code>const myArray = [];</code> JavaScript has powerful methods
              to be used by arrays.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pop() removes the last item from an array. Ex: myArray.pop();
              </li>
              <li>
                The shift() method removes the first item of an array. Ex:
                myArray.shift();
              </li>
              <li>
                The push() method appends a new value to the end of the array.
                Ex: myArray.push();
              </li>
              <li>
                The unshift() method appends a new value at the beginning of the
                array
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Function</h3>
            <p>
              A function is a group of statements that together perform one task
              and can be referenced by name. functions help reduce repetition
              and make code easier. There are three most common ways to define a
              function in JavaScript. Here are some of the ways to define a
              function in JavaScript. <br />
              Function Declaration <br />
              <code
                >function greetings(){<br />
                console.log('Hello World!');<br />
                } </code
              ><br />
              Function Expression <br />
              <code
                >const goodbye = function(){<br />
                console.log('Goodbye World!');<br />
                }; </code
              ><br />
              Arrow Function <br />
              <code>const hello = () => alert('Hello World!');</code><br />
              A function without a name is known as an anonymous function. To
              invoke a function in JavaScript, type the name of the function
              then followed by parenthesis. Eg. <code>greetings ();</code> A
              callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to
              another function.
