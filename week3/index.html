          <h3>Objects</h3>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, an object is a collection of named properties with
            related values and functions. Object act like a dictionary where
            you use a property name to look for its value. Objects are used to
            keep related information and functionality together in the same
            place.

          <h3>Objects Literals</h3>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, object literals are created by wrapping their
            properties and methods in curly braces. Each property is stored in
            key-value pairs separated by commas. Properties with the typeOf
            function are called methods. Yes, object literals can have
            functions inside them. All objects are mutable at any time when a
            program is running. This means that its properties and methods can
            be changed or removed, and new properties and methods can be added
            to the object, even if it was declared using const. Here is an
            example of an object literal.  <br>
            <code>
                const customer = { <br>
                  name: 'Joe Doe', <br>
                  account: 'current' }
              </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation:
            customer.name You can also access an object’s properties using
            bracket notation ― the property is represented by a string inside
            square brackets, so needs to be placed inside single or double
            quotation marks: <code>customer[“name”]</code><br />
            Some importance of using objects is, it is created quickly without
            the need of defining a class, and they also provide a useful way
            of organizing your code without polluting the global namespace.

          <h3>Object Method "this"</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript objects are usually created to represent entities of
            the real world. The use of objects in our code is termed
            object-oriented programming. <br />
            The use of <code>this</code> keyword is used by methods to access
            methods. The value of <code>this</code> is referenced to the
            object. What is the benefit of using this keyword in our code? We
            can access the object without the use of
            <code>this</code> referencing it to an outer variable. We may
            likely overwrite the object when we assign it to another variable.
            In JavaScript, <code>this</code> is not bound. It can be used in
            any function even if it is not a method of an object. Its value is
            evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was
            declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.

          <h3>The Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
          <p>
            <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> allows you to access elements of a web page and enable
            interaction with the page. It represents an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document as a
            network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure. We can
            use JavaScript to access and modify different parts of a web page
            using a special built-in object called a document. The <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>
            provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a
            page. These objects can then be assigned to a variable and
            inspected or modified. Eg: <code>const body = document.body;</code><br />
            We can use some <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> methods to get any elements of a webpage and
            interact with it. Here are some examples of using these methods.
            The <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> has numerous getter and setter methods that can be used
            to
            view, add, remove or modify the value of any of these attributes.
            The document.getElementById(), document.getElementsByClassName(),
            document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can
            be used to access elements on a page. <br />
            An element’s attributes can be accessed using the <code>getAttribute()</code>
            method, and updated using the <code>setAttribute()</code> method. <br />
            The <code>createElement()</code> and <code>createTextNode()</code> methods can be used to
            create dynamic markup on the fly. <br />
            Markup can be added to the page using the <code>appendChild()</code> and
            <code>insertBefore()</code> methods. <br />
            Elements can be replaced using the <code>replaceChild()</code> method and
            removed using the <code>removeChild()</code> method. <br />
            The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly
            into the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>. <br />
            The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the
            style property.

          <h3>Events</h3>
          <p>
            Events are another part of the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> and they are what provide the
            link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user
            interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a
            key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can
            detect and then respond to. JavaScript uses the event listener to
            check when an event happens, and the program that can respond
            appropriately. An event listener is attached to an element, then
            invokes a callback function when the event occurs. There are many
            types of events, including mouse events, keyboard events, and
            touch events. Syntax of adding event listener:
            <code>document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);</code>
