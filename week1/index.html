          <h3>LocalStorage:</h3>
          <p>
            LocalStorage is a type of web storage that helps users to store
            data in a key-value pair in the web browser. The benefit of using
            the localStorage is to store data for a long time without expiry
            as compared to other web storage. Using JavaScript, you can use
            the key to retrieve the value which is the object stored in the
            storage. Here are the JavaScript syntaxes to set and retrieve data
            from the localStorage respectively.
            <code>localStorage.setItem("key", "value");</code>,
            <code>localStorage.getItem("key");</code>

          <h3>UX Mobile Design:</h3>
          <p>
            Most people use portable or mobile devices with different screen sizes and resolutions. We need to design
            with mobile first in mind. Mobile-first design is a way of creating a design by understanding mobile and
            users.<br>
            Designing with mobile-first design is time-consuming but can save you a cost for future maintenance and
            fixing. Which provides the best user experience across different devices. Doing mobile first in mind will
            make it easier for your website to adjust to future trends. It also helps the website to fully function on
            the least mobile devices.
          <ul>
            Here are some benefits of mobile-first design:
            <li>
              It prevents drops in traffic and revenue on your website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users are likely to stay a little longer on your website.
            </li>
            <li>
              It gives your website full functionality on the smallest mobile design.
            </li>
          </ul>
          We can start the application of mobile-first design by focusing on designing reachability primary controls,
          limiting ads on your website, and keeping up to date with the latest trends. <q>Mobile is evolving quickly</q>.
