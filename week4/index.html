            <h3>Forms</h3>
            <p>
              Forms are one of the methods of interacting with web pages. Many
              websites use forms to interact with users. Users use forms to log
              in to their favorite websites. JavaScript is one of the web
              technologies that can be used to interact with form elements on a
              website. JavaScript can be used to give form control, validate
              forms, retrieve, and change values from a form, among others. A
              form is made of a <code>form</code> element that contains form
              controls such as input fields, buttons, textarea, and select
              menus.
            </p>
            <br>
            When accessing form elements, we can use the following ways to do
            that: <br>
            <code>
              const form = document.forms[0]; <br>
              const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];<br>
              const form = document.forms['search'];<br>
            </code>
            we can also access the form controls using the name attributes in
            the HTML as if it is an object property. Here are examples:
            <code>const input = form.searchInput</code> or
            <code>const input = form['searchInput']</code>
                <h4>Forms Events</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>The focus event triggers when a form element is focused</li>
                  <li>
                    The bur event triggers when a focused element is unfocused
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The change event triggers when the focus is moved away from the
                    form after changing it
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The submit event is used to intercept a form before it’s been
                    submitted
                  </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Form Validation</h3>
            <p>
              Form validation is the process of ensuring users enter information
              correctly into a form. Form validation can be used to check a
              valid email, minimum password characters, a completed required
              field, etc. JavaScript can be used to validate forms both on the
              client side and the server side. To ensure more valid data is sent
              to the server, it is advisable to use both methods of validation.
              Using JavaScript in validation is used to enhance the user
              experience by giving feedback and preventing errors before the
              form is submitted. <br>
              HTML5 has its own form validation API that can be used. The API
              works by adding relevant attributes to the form fields. For
              example, if a field is required simply add required attribute to
              the field.

            <h3>Disabling the Submit Button</h3>
            <p>
              A submit button can be disabled by adding the disabled attribute
              to the <code>input</code> element: <br>
              <code
                >&lt;button type='submit' id='submit'
                disabled>Submit&lt;/button></code
              ><br>
              This can be changed programmatically using the disabled property
              of the <code>button</code> element. The following function will
              disable the button if an input field is empty: <br>
              <code
                >function disableSubmit(event) {<br>
                if(event.target.value === ''){<br>
                document.getElementById('submit').disabled = true;<br>
                } else {<br>
                document.getElementById('submit').disabled = false;<br>
                }<br>
                }
              </code>
            </p>

            <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
            <p>
              Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that
              uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods.
              The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism, and
              inheritance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Encapsulation is then defined as the process of hiding details of
              code from other code so that it can’t be seen or used by them. The
              benefit of using encapsulation in OOP is to minimize the
              interdependencies between different parts of our program and
              prevent them from breaking due to changes made in the code or the
              program. An application of encapsulation is modifiers to hide
              attributes of classes so that other code does not attempt to
              change them directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Polymorphism is the ability of a child object to change the
              behavior of a method inherited from a parent object. The
              importance of polymorphism requires the skillful application of
              abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance, resulting in a
              powerful mechanism to ensure a flexible change in a program. It
              also helps to reuse codes in our program.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class obtains the
              attributes and methods of another prototype automatically. That
              is, without having to type all the attributes and the methods
              again. The benefit of using inheritance in our programs is to save
              many hours of coding. The application of inheritance saves us to
              write prototype attributes and methods over and over again which
              permits us to reuse code.
            </p>

                <h4>Classes</h4>
                <p>
                  Before ES6, JavaScript didn’t have classes. It used the
                  concept of using actual objects as the blueprint for creating
                  more objects. This is known as a prototype-based language.
                  Even though ES6 now supports classes, it still uses this
                  prototypal inheritance model in the background.

            <h3>Modular JavaScript</h3>
            <h4>ES6 Modules</h4>
            <p>
              JavaScript introduces modules in ES6. Modules allow you to keep
              parts of code in self-contained files. An ES6 module file is just
              a normal JavaScript file but uses the keyword export to specify
              any values or functions that are to be made available from the
              module. Example: export <code>const PI = 3.1415926;</code> saved
              in pi.js file. Can be used in the main.js as
              <code>import { PI } from './pi.js';</code><br>
              If there are a lot of values and functions to be imported, you can
              import it as an example:
              <code>import * as PI from './pi.js';</code>
            </p>
            Some important points about modules to be noted:
            <ul>
              <li>
                All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need
                for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.
              </li>
              <li>
                A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in
                the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that
                module.
              </li>
              <li>
                The value of this in the top level of a module is undefined,
                rather than the global object.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can’t use HTML-style comments in modules (although this
                isn’t verycommon in any JavaScript program these days).
              </li>
