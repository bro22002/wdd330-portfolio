                    <h3>Memoization</h3>
                    <p>Memoization is a useful feature that provides result caching. We can use this to save the
                        return value of a function in a cache property. Memoization is useful in functions that take
                        time to compute the return value. This makes it possible to return the value from the cache
                        when the same argument is used again rather than having to compute the result again. For
                        example, we can write a function to calculate the square of a number like this:</p>

                    <p>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression is an anonymous function that is invoked as soon
                        as it’s defined. we use parentheses to invoke a function. To write an Immediately Invoked
                        Function, we place parentheses at the end of the function definition. The function also has
                        to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole declaration inside
                        parentheses, as in this example:</p>

                    <p>IIFEs are a useful way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up within the
                        scope of the function. This means the global namespace is not polluted with lots of variable
                        names.</p>

                    <h3>Temporary Variables</h3>
                    <p>Variables can not be removed from a scope once it has been declared. If a variable is only
                        required temporarily, it may cause confusion if it’s still available later in the code. The
                        variable name may clash with another piece of code perhaps in an external JavaScript library
                        which might cause errors. Putting any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will
                        ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear. The example that
                        follows uses an IIFE to swap the value of two global variables, a and b. This process requires
                        the use of a temporary variable, called temp, which only exists while the IIFE is invoked:</p>

                    <h3>Safe Use of Strict Mode</h3>
                    <p>Placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in
                        the file. To avoid this, the recommended way to use strict mode is to place all your code inside
                        an IIFE. This makes only the code in the IIFE is forced to use strict mode, like so:</p>

                    <h3>Promises</h3>
                    <p>A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. Promises don’t do anything
                        that can’t already be achieved using callbacks, but they help simplify the process and avoid the
                        convoluted code that can result from using multiple callbacks.</p>

                            <h4>Creating A Promise</h4>
                            <p>A promise is created using a constructor function. This takes a function called an
                                executor as an argument. The executor initializes the promise and starts the
                                asynchronous operation. It also accepts two functions as arguments: the resolve()
                                function is called if the operation is successful, and the reject() function is called
                                if the operation fails. The general layout of a promise can be seen in the code below:

                    <p>Async functions that are preceded by the async keyword and allow you to write asynchronous code
                        as if it was synchronous. This is done by using the await operator before an asynchronous
                        function. This will wrap the return value of the function in a promise that can then be assigned
                        to a variable. The next line of code is not executed until the promise is resolved.</p>

                    <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
                    <p>Functional programming uses pure functions as the building blocks of a program. The functions
                        perform a series of operations without changing the state of any data. Each function forms an
                        abstraction that should perform a single task while encapsulating the details of its
                        implementation inside the body of the function.</p>
                    <p>By only performing a single task, pure functions are more flexible, as they can be used as the
                        building blocks for many different situations, rather than be tightly coupled with one
                        particular operation. They also help to make your code more modular, as each function can be
                        improved upon or replaced without interfering with any of the other functions. This makes it
                        easy to replace one function with another to either improve the behavior, modify it slightly, or
                        even change it completely.</p>
                    <p>Functional programming uses pure functions to make code more concise and predictable than in the
                        other programming styles. Referential transparency makes pure functions easy to test as they can
                        be relied on to return the same values when the same arguments are provided. Another benefit is
                        that any return values can be cached since they’re always the same. The absence of any side
                        effects tends to reduce the amounts of bugs that can creep into your code because there are no
                        surprise dependencies as they only rely on any values provided as arguments.</p>

                    <h3>Ajax</h3>
                    <p>Ajax is a technique used by web pages to send and receive data asynchronously in the background
                        without page reloading. Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of
                        the client. The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML
                        rather than a whole web page. Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</p>

                    <h3>JSON Response</h3>
                    <p>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used to deal
                        with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript
                        object. Here is an example of how a JSON response promise would be resolved, this means we can
                        manipulate the object using JavaScript. In the example below, the Object.entries() method is
                        used to view the key and value pairs in the returned object.:</p>
